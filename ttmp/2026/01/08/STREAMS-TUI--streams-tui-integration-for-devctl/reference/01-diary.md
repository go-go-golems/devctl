# Diary

## Goal

Fix and enhance the Streams TUI in devctl to make streams usable and discoverable.

## Step 1: Analysis and Investigation

Analyzed the existing streams infrastructure to understand what was implemented and why streams weren't working in the TUI.

### What I did
- Read all stream-related source files (stream_runner.go, streams_model.go, etc.)
- Documented the complete architecture in analysis report
- Set up a demo repo at `/tmp/devctl-stream-demo` with telemetry plugin
- Tested CLI streams (`devctl stream start`) - works correctly
- Tested TUI streams - discovered critical bug
- Used tmux automation to reproduce the issue

### What worked
- CLI streams work perfectly, confirming protocol/runtime layer is correct
- Message bus wiring is complete (transform, forward)
- StreamsModel renders and responds to keyboard input

### What didn't work
- TUI streams fail immediately with "context canceled"
- Stream shows "running" briefly then "error"
- No events are ever displayed

### What I learned
- The entire streams infrastructure is implemented and well-designed
- The bug is isolated to a single line in stream_runner.go
- UX needs improvement but core functionality is sound

### What was tricky to build
- N/A (analysis phase)

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The context usage pattern in message handlers

### What should be done in the future
- Consider adding stream descriptions to plugin handshake protocol
- Consider stream persistence across TUI restarts

### Technical details

Root cause identified:
```go
// pkg/tui/stream_runner.go:181
streamCtx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)  // ctx is msg.Context()
```

The `ctx` is the Watermill message context, which is canceled when the handler returns. This kills the stream immediately.

---

## Step 2: Fix Context Cancellation Bug

Fixed the critical bug that prevents streams from running.

**Commit (code):** f1b1761 — "Fix: use background context for stream lifecycle"

### What I did
- Modified `pkg/tui/stream_runner.go` in 3 places:
  1. Line 125: factory.Start() for explicit plugin ID case
  2. Line 152: factory.Start() for auto-discovery loop case
  3. Line 187: streamCtx creation for forwardEvents goroutine
- Changed all from message context to `context.Background()`
- Rebuilt binary and tested with demo repo

### Why
The stream context and plugin process were derived from the Watermill message context. When the message handler returned, the context was canceled, which:
1. Killed the plugin process (via exec.CommandContext)
2. Canceled the stream context (triggering forwardEvents exit)

This caused streams to immediately fail with "context canceled".

### What worked
- All 10 metric events received
- Stream shows "ended" status (not "error")
- Clean termination with `[end]` event

### What was tricky to build
- There were actually 3 places using the message context, not just the obvious streamCtx
- The factory.Start calls also pass context to exec.CommandContext, which kills the process on cancellation

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Confirm no other context usages in stream_runner.go need similar treatment
- The unused `ctx` parameter in handleStart could be removed or documented

### Code review instructions
- Look at `stream_runner.go` lines 125, 152, and 187
- Verify all context.Background() usages are correct
- Run test: `cd /tmp/devctl-stream-demo && devctl tui`, navigate to Streams, press 'n', enter `{"op":"telemetry.stream","plugin_id":"telemetry","input":{"count":10}}`

---

## Step 3: Enhance Stream Row Display

Added duration and event count to stream rows for better visibility.

**Commit (code):** 946fcc3 — "Enhance: add duration and event count to stream rows"

### What I did
- Added `EventCount` field to `streamRow` struct
- Updated `onStreamEvent` to increment event count for each event
- Enhanced `renderStreamList` to display:
  - Status icon (●/○/✗)
  - Status text
  - Operation name
  - Plugin ID
  - Duration (using existing `formatDuration` from service_model.go)
  - Event count

### What worked
- Stream row now shows: `> ○ ended  telemetry.stream  telemetry  4s  11 events`
- Much more informative than the old: `> ended telemetry.stream (plugin=telemetry)`

### What was tricky to build
- Had to reuse the existing `formatDuration` function from service_model.go rather than creating a duplicate

### Code review instructions
- Look at `streams_model.go` streamRow struct and renderStreamList function
- Run TUI, start a stream, verify the new display format

---

## Step 4: Improve Empty State and Plugin Stream Indicator

Added helpful instructions to empty state and prepared plugin stream indicator.

**Commit (code):** d50557b — "Enhance: improve streams empty state and add plugin stream indicator"

### What I did
- Updated streams empty state with:
  - Explanation of how to start a stream
  - JSON format example
  - Reference to Plugins view and CLI alternative
- Added Ops and Streams fields to PluginSummary struct
- Added stream indicator (📊 stream) to plugin row title line
- Updated PluginModel.WithPlugins to pass through Ops/Streams

### What worked
- Empty state now shows helpful instructions
- Infrastructure for stream indicator is in place

### What requires future work
- **Plugin introspection**: To show stream capabilities, we need to start plugins
  and read their handshake. The state watcher doesn't do this currently.
- **Quick-start picker**: Without introspection, we can't show available stream ops.

### Technical decision
Rather than implementing runtime plugin introspection (expensive, starts all plugins),
I focused on improving the UX with better empty state instructions. Users can still:
1. Check plugin documentation for available stream ops
2. Use `devctl stream start --op <op>` to discover ops (fails fast if unsupported)
3. Look at plugin source code to see handshake capabilities

## Step 5: Summary

### Completed
1. ✅ Fixed critical context cancellation bug (commit f1b1761)
2. ✅ Enhanced stream row display with duration/event count (commit 946fcc3)
3. ✅ Improved empty state with instructions (commit d50557b)
4. ✅ Added plugin stream indicator infrastructure (commit d50557b)

### Deferred (requires plugin introspection)
- [ ] Populate plugin Ops/Streams from runtime handshake
- [ ] Add quick-start stream picker [q]
- [ ] Add streams widget to Dashboard

### All commits
```
d50557b Enhance: improve streams empty state and add plugin stream indicator
946fcc3 Enhance: add duration and event count to stream rows
5f9483e Docs: add STREAMS-TUI ticket with analysis and design
f1b1761 Fix: use background context for stream lifecycle
```

### Testing Performed
- Started telemetry stream with 10 events
- Verified all events received
- Verified stream completes with "ended" status
- Verified duration and event count display correctly
- Verified empty state shows helpful instructions
